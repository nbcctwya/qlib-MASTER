"""Custom data handlers for running the MASTER model on US (SP500) data.

Background
----------
MASTER expects ``d_feat=158`` (the Alpha158 factor set) plus 63 market-guided features.
On ``us_data`` there is **no ``$vwap`` bin**, so Alpha158's ``VWAP0`` feature
(``$vwap/$close``) is all-NaN on every US stock. Dropping the feature would shrink
``d_feat`` and break the model's ``gate_input_start_index=158`` assumption.

``Alpha158US`` swaps only the ``$vwap``-based feature for a typical-price proxy, so the
158-feature count and the MASTER architecture are preserved. The CSI300 run keeps using
the original ``Alpha158`` unchanged.
